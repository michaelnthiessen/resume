# Resume
This is my online resume-site, which contains a portfolio of projects I have worked on.

For my best and most recent software engineering, take a look at the [COMP 3350 project](https://github.com/RyPope/COMP3350) that I (as user tesla3327) contributed to.

This project was a group project for a software engineering course. We built an app to help a photographer keep track of her clients and create quotes and invoices easily. My main task was to create the event system, that would pull events from various sources and alert the user. This proved to be much more difficult to design than anticipated, as this event system had to integrate with many subsystems of the app.

For some design work, check out [my personal site](www.michaelnthiessen.com), as well as the [iOS-Design project](https://github.com/michaelnthiessen/iOS-Design).
