# Resume
This is my online resume-site, which contains a portfolio of projects I have worked on.

## Get That Course
The University of Manitoba doesn't have a wait list feature for students trying to get into courses. This results in the major hassle of constantly checking and refreshing the webpage to see if a spot has opened. Instead, I wrote a program that does this for you, and simply emails you when a spot opens up. Students loved this, and I got emails from random people complaining when I took it down.<br>

## Google Maps Filter
Takes any JSON data with coordinates, and generates filters based on the properties of each object.<br>

## Software Engineering Project
[COMP 3350 project](https://github.com/RyPope/COMP3350) that I (as user tesla3327) contributed to in my third year CS program.

This project was a group project for a software engineering course. We built an app to help a photographer keep track of her clients and create quotes and invoices easily. My main task was to create the event system, that would pull events from various sources and alert the user. This proved to be much more difficult to design than anticipated, as this event system had to integrate with many subsystems of the app.

## iOS Design
Awhile ago I decided to design an app to see what the process was like. This is what I ended up with.<br>
[iOS-Design project](https://github.com/michaelnthiessen/iOS-Design).
