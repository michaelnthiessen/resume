# Resume

(the account tesla3327 is also my account)

This is my online resume-site, which contains a portfolio of projects I have worked on.

For my best and most recent software engineering, take a look at the COMP 3350 project that I (as user tesla3327) contributed to.
For some design work, check out michaelnthiessen.com, as well as the iOS-Design project.
