# Resume
This is my online resume-site, which contains a portfolio of projects I have worked on.

## Color Palette
A simple color palette tool that I built in React a few months ago for fun. It will adjust adjust saturation and lightness in opposite directions to make the colors more natural (darker colors are more saturated).

It's based on create-react-app, so you can easily run it using `npm install && npm start`.

## Injectr
This was a test to see how easy it would be to inject React components into a page, loading them from a URL. The experiment was to try and see if we could decouple React components from a legacy application that was incredibly difficult to update. The idea was that if we only had to update the React components, life would be simpler.

The experiment failed in the end, but it was fun to figure this out.

## Adrenaline Escapes
I built a very simple website and booking system for my sister's escape room in Manitoba.

The website is responsive, and the booking system is backed by a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It provided a simple way to store the data and be able to make changes and edits without having to build a whole front-end for managing the data.

## Marketplace Disciples
This is the site where I interview Christian business owners.

I work on the site when I can, so there is a lot that still needs to be added.

## Google Maps Filter
This project is from over 2 years ago, built in vanilla Javascript + CSS.

Takes any JSON data with coordinates, and generates filters based on the properties of each object.<br>
